# Wordle Bot
This project is based on the popular web-based word game known as Wordle. The gameâ€™s primary objective is to guess a 5-letter word within a specific number of attempts. In each guess, we receive feedback in the form of colored indicators: green, yellow, and gray. The green color indicates that the letter we guessed is correct, and it is also in the right position. The yellow color indicates that the letter we guessed is correct but in the wrong position. Finally, the gray color indicates that the letter we guessed is incorrect and does not appear in the word. These feedback colors provide valuable information for players to narrow down their guesses and eventually guess the word correctly.


## Notes

The `requirements.txt` file lists all Python libraries that the implementation depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
